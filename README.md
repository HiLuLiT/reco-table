## To Run this repo locally :
- `git clone`
- Run `npm i && npm start`

## Stack & Packages:
- `create-react-app` React for the UI 
- `chakra-ui` - for Styling
- `axios` for creating an Api Client instance

## If I Had More Time:
- I now see I forgot to add a selection at the bottom of the page for `pageSize`, but that would be easy to implement- I would probably choose a popular selection component like `react-select` and modify the ApiClient param accordignly.
- Didn't get to second part - but if i did , I would go with react-virtualized or react-window: Both libraries are great for rendering large lists and tabular data efficiently.
- Implement error handling and loading with `react-query` (for many reasons, also great for async state handling, but wasn't really needed)
- Add more styling sheets - such as general, resets, colors & mixins (woohoo)
